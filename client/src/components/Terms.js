                            Service. In such event, all unused Coins will expire immediately

                            an account. However, if you choose to purchase and/or use Coins
                            without logging into your account, the purchased Coins and
                            unlocked episodes (“Purchased Items”) will only be stored on your
                            device. This means you will not be able to transfer Purchased
                            Items to another device, and in the event you delete the WEBTOON
                            App from your device, all Purchased Items will be deleted
                            permanently and cannot be restored even if the WEBTOON app is
                            reinstalled.
